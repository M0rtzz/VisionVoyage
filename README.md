> This project is associated with the courses `Basis of Innovation and Entrepreneurship ＆ Engineering Design Practice (创新创业基础与工程设计实践)`  and `Productive Practice (生产实习)` of the CS major at ZZU.
>
> I led a simulation of a software company called `Ingenuity Drive (创智行)` and developed a software called `VisionVoyage`. We need to play different roles:

> VisionVoyage is an autonomous driving simulation system that leverages  fisheye cameras and other sensing technologies, providing the following  capabilities:
>
> - Fisheye transformation of a single standard image
> - Mosaic of fisheye images from multiple standard images
> - Semantic segmentation of fisheye (e.g., [WoodScape](https://woodscape.valeo.com/woodscape)) and standard (e.g., [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com)) images in street scenes
> - Semantic segmentation of video in street scenes (such as videos stitched from [continuous datasets published by Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads))
>   -  ![Cityscapes](https://static.m0rtzz.com/images/Year:2024/Month:08/Day:15/17:24:53_Cityscapes.png)
>
> - Simulated driving
> - Autonomous driving simulation
> - Shooting of simulated fisheye semantic segmentation dataset
> - Experience with a variety of simulated sensors, including:
>   - Camera Fisheye
>   - Camera RGB
>   - Camera Depth (Raw)
>   - Camera Semantic Segmentation (Raw)
>   - Camera Semantic Segmentation (Cityscapes Palette)
>   - Camera Instance Segmentation (Raw)
>   - Dynamic Vision
>   - Optical Flow
>   - Camera Normals
>   - Lidar (Ray-Cast)
>   - etc
